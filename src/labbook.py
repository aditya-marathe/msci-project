Contains tools updating records of my digitial "lab book" for this project. The
lab book keeps a record of the trained Keras models with my own commentary or
observations. 

Also, a GUI application called "LabBook" used to (1) read and display the stored 
records, (2) test the trained models, and (3) compare the test results with 
other models.
