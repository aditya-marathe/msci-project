# PyOscCalc
Python Neutrino Oscillation Calculator

This is a very rough port of Josh Boehm's OscCalc C++ package for calculating eneutrino oscillation probabilities. The main components are:
* OscCalc.py -- The oscillation calculator as a python library
* FluxTools.py -- A silly class that fakes neutrino fluxes
* DetectorTools.py -- A silly class thate fakes neutrino detectors
* PyOscCalc.ipynb -- The Juypter notebook demonstrating some of the features
